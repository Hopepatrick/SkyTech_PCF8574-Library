# SkyTech_PCF8574-Library
The SkyTech_PCF8574 Library is a custom Arduino library developed by Patrick from SkyTech Electronics to  simplify interactions with the PCF8574 I2C GPIO Expander. This library provides an interface for setting pin  directions and reading/writing values to individual pins, making it ideal for remote control of GPIO  configurations.
